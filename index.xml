What this essentially means is that each path should be able to be resolved independently when using variables in path segments.
For example &amp;lsquo;/burgers/{burgerId}&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;/{foodType}/burgers&amp;rsquo; are ambiguous, they can&amp;rsquo;t be resolved and either could trigger a different operation.
Why did this violation appear? Ambiguous paths were detected, paths that can&amp;rsquo;t be used together in the same specification.</description></item><item><title>ambiguousPaths</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/openapi/ambiguouspaths/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/openapi/ambiguouspaths/</guid><description>ambiguousPaths will evaluate every path in the specification, against one another, to ensure that they are all resolvable and don&amp;rsquo;t conflict with one another.

I wanted to do something not awful when it comes to the HTML report. vacuum can generate a self-contained interactive UI experience for exploring linting results from an OpenAPI specification, or a vacuum report.
The report has no dependencies, and it makes no network calls.

Sometimes we need more power, we need the ability to hook in custom code and custom business logic.
Spectral does a great job with custom functions, So, vacuum has adopted a very similar design, to facilitate custom functions.
vacuum is written in go, so it can only run functions also written in go. Structure of a custom function A custom function is written the exact same way that all functions are written in vacuum.</description></item><item><title>API Quick Start</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/getting-started/</guid><description>vacuum has been designed to work as an API from the ground up. This was actually one of the motivators behind the development of the tool.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a golang developer, and you want to lint OpenAPI specs using a library, then look no further.
Install vacuum install vacuum Lint an OpenAPI Spec This simple quick start code will read in an OpenAPI, generate a RuleSet from the built-in defaults, Then it will apply the rules to the spec, filter the results by a category, and then print them out to the console.</description></item><item><title>lint command</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/lint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/lint/</guid><description>The fastest way to see something useful is to print something out to the console.
lint This will print a summary of your linting results. The lint command will use the Recommended RuleSet.
Just want to try things out? If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an OpenAPI spec and you want to see something, you can run it against one of the test specifications. A good one to try is the petstorev3.</description></item><item><title>The Index</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/spec-index/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/spec-index/</guid><description>The first iteration of vacuum had no index. Every rule would walk through the specification nodes, looking for what ever it is the function does. This worked great, except.. it didn&amp;rsquo;t.
vacuum would slow way down on complex rules like oas3-valid-schema-example.
It slowed down to the point where it was taking seconds to run on very large specs. This was no good.
After a re-think and many prototypes, I designed a simple index that will seek out everything in the specification and hold a reference.</description></item><item><title>All Rules</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/all/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 05:30:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/all/</guid><description>Want to throw the kitchen sink at your OpenAPI specification? Use All the rules!
To configure all the rules, you can simply use the same mechanism Spectral uses for extending a ruleset.
Create a new file (something like all-rules.yaml) and add the following YAML to it:
extends: [[spectral:oas, all]] This creates a ruleset that extends &amp;lsquo;all&amp;rsquo; rules. You can find this ruleset in the rulesets/examples directory, and it&amp;rsquo;s named all-ruleset.</description></item><item><title>Core Concepts</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/concepts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 12:20:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/concepts/</guid><description>There are three core concepts when it comes to vacuum.
Function Rule RuleSet Functions power Rules and Rules make up RuleSets What are Rules? Rules are filters that define a set of target values you want to check against. Rules define what to look up, where to find it and what to check for. Those options are then sent to a function that will execute that logic.
Rules enforce a company or product API style guide.</description></item><item><title>Why should you care?</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/why/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 12:20:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/why/</guid><description>Why should I care about OpenAPI? Open API is the de-facto choice for designing and documenting REST APIs. Following an API First123 strategy allows teams to design and define, test, mock and explore APIs without building any code.
It allows service providers and consumers to work independently, using a strongly defined, rich API contract.
Why do I need an OpenAPI linter? We are human and we suck at writing. Even when something looks syntactically correct, it will probably still read like garbage.</description></item><item><title>xor</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/core/xor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 09:43:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/core/xor/</guid><description>xor will check that a only one of two properties is set/defined within a given JSON Path.

If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with STOMP, it stands for (S)imple (T)ext (O)riented (M)essaging (P)rotocol. It&amp;rsquo;s a straightforward but stable protocol that makes interacting with a message or event-based APIs a breeze.</description></item><item><title>Thank you, VMware.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:06:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</guid><description>This is my story about the most incredible time I had at VMware.

A bumpy arrival In early 2012, I was the CTO of a failing start-up that I co-founded. Money had dried up; I had to let go of everything.
I had recently emigrated to the USA from the UK, and my (ex) wife was divorcing me because she had fallen in love with another man she had met while I was trying to build a business.</description></item><item><title>How to create a streaming AsyncAPI microservice using golang.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</guid><description>Watch the video If you want to learn more about AsyncAPI, head over to AsyncAPI.com and find out more about the standard and the power it provides us.

I had been working for VMware for around eight months.
I was excited to be working (finally) in Silicon Valley; A dream of mine since childhood.
One wintery afternoon, Mornay Van Der Walt Called me into his office. He asked me
&amp;ldquo;Do you think we could build a prototype that installs and configures an entire SDDC in a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance format and do it in under 15 Minutes&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>TrashBox, Engineering a solution to memory loss.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:23:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Dammit, why am I unable to get this under control!&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself as I ran, dragging two weeks worth of hot, stinking garbage toward the collection truck that was just about to drive past my house again.

I just wanted to say, that I am sorry if I have offended you.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t ever a situation in which I am trying to be hurtful, or exert rudeness (I hate both of those things).
If you have experienced emotional distress because of something I did, said or wrote, then please accept my genuine apology ♥️.
Sometimes, I misread intent. Sometimes I forget how brutal even the most innocent words can be, when used in a certain context.</description></item><item><title>What is Experience Engineering?</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</guid><description>OK, so I know I just said that it&amp;rsquo;s an actual term. It&amp;rsquo;s a term that I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of made up. It is, however, composed of real things that all revolve around designing and building experiences.
More than just user interface It&amp;rsquo;s easy to default to &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;oh you mean UI, right?&amp;rdquo; when talking about engineering experiences.
The reality, however, is the term &amp;lsquo;UI&amp;rsquo; means more than a browser-based application. UI goes way beyond that.</description></item><item><title>Author</title><link>https://quobix.com/author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 16:50:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/author/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dave Shanley.

Any other object can reference it, to save duplication.
Sometimes schema definitions are never referenced from anywhere, they are &amp;lsquo;unused&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;orphaned&amp;rsquo;.
This could be an oversight, it could be a case where the spec was changed and new schemas have replaced older ones, and those older schema definitions were never removed.
It&amp;rsquo;s good contract hygiene to prune anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t used, out of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
