This rule checks that for every component there is a description set.
Why did this violation appear? One or more description elements in the spec are missing from a component (v3+)
Bad example components: schemas: ChickenNugget: type: object properties: id: type: integer name: type: string Good example components: schemas: ChickenNugget: type: object description: &amp;#34;This represents a chicken nugget, used for all kinds of nugget fun.</description></item><item><title>description-duplication</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/description-duplication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 05:59:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/description-duplication/</guid><description>Descriptions are really important. Often, contract authors copy and paste a lot. This it because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to copy and paste things and modify them, rather than typing out a bunch of YAML or JSON.
The problem with copy and pasting for contracts should be clear. Duplication of content is everywhere, including descriptions. This is really un-helpful for anyone trying to understand a contract, not to mention creating a really poor experience for documentation users.</description></item><item><title>oas3-parameter-description</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas3-parameter-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:59:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas3-parameter-description/</guid><description>This rule checks that Parameters contain a description.
Descriptions for parameters are really important. Documentation generation tools use this description as the main bulk of the documentation for describing what a parameter does and its effect.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how often API authors leave this blank or don&amp;rsquo;t put anything meaningful in here.
Why did this violation appear? One Parameter or more are missing a description.
Bad example paths: /chicken/nuggets/{nuggetId}: get: summary: &amp;#34;Get a chicken nugget by ID&amp;#34; parameters: - in: path name: nuggetId schema: type: integer required: true .</description></item><item><title>oas2-parameter-description</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas2-parameter-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:58:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas2-parameter-description/</guid><description>This rule checks that Parameters contain a description.

Descriptions for operations are really important. Documentation generation tools use this description as the main bulk of the documentation for the operation.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how often API authors leave this blank or don&amp;rsquo;t put anything meaningful in here.
Why did this violation appear? An Operation Object or more are missing a description, or the if there is one, it&amp;rsquo;s got too few words to pass.</description></item></channel></rss>
