Tags are used as navigation/taxonomy meta-data for documentation and code generation tooling. Descriptions are really important for consumers.
Why did this violation appear? One or more global tags does not contain a description
Bad example openapi: 3.0.1 tags: - name: &amp;#34;Tag1&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Tag2&amp;#34; info: ... Good Example openapi: 3.0.1 tags: - name: &amp;#34;Tag1&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Tag1 is a tag for group 1, and related things&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Tag2&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Tag2 is a tag for group 2, which is only for one thing.</description></item><item><title>operation-tags</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tags/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 04:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tags/</guid><description>Operations make use of Tags to group operations together. Tags are really important for documentation and exploring tools.
This rule checks that an operation has defined tags, and that at least one exists. This rule is a more generic and more useful version of the operation-singular-tag.
Why did this violation appear? One or more operation in the specification does not have a tags property that contains at least a single tag.</description></item><item><title>openapi-tags</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags/</guid><description>Global Tags define meta-data that can then be used by Operations and Paths Rules
Why did this violation appear? Global tags have not been defined, or they are not an array as required by the schema.

Why did this violation appear? Global tags are not listed alphabetically for one or more operations.
Bad example tags: - name: &amp;#34;Nuggets&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Chicken nuggets&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Apples&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Apples are great&amp;#34; Good Example tags: - name: &amp;#34;Apples&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Apples are great&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Nuggets&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Chicken nuggets&amp;#34; How do I fix this violation?</description></item></channel></rss>
